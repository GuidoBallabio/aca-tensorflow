ACA project on implementation, evaluation and comparison of CNNs:

Train a CNN model for Cifar-10 or MNIST dataset with Tensorflow then use Quantization methods present in Tensorflow framework to generate models with possibly different quantization/compression methdos. Compare all the models on the basis of model accuracy in inference forwardpass, execution time performance, size of the models.
